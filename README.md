From the statistics, it seems Capomulin and Ramicane are the most effective treatments.
In the statistics dealing with Capomulin, there was a very clear correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume 
The fact that Capomulin and Ramicane had the two lowest mean tumor volumes could be indicative that the average weight of the mice they dealt with was lower. We would have to compare the average mouse weight of all the treatments, to see the true effectiveness of Capomulin and Ramicane.
The fact that Capomulin and Ramicane have the two highest number of observable timepoints is significant in terms of the validity of their results.
The max-timepoint statistic could be misleading, as it doesnâ€™t take into account the size of the tumor before treatment, versus after treatment. We may have to look further, perhaps in seeing the average percentage increase/increase of tumor size per treatment.
However, the line plot which indicates the clear trend of decline in tumor volume over time of treatment, is very significant as an argument for the clear effectiveness of Capomulin
